# Showcasing Data Analysis Skills with Python
The notebooks in this repository showcase my Python skills in:
* Loading and exploring datasets.
* Identifying and addressing missing data effectively.
* Identifying and removing outliers using statistical thresholds.
* Calculating correlation relationships between key variables.
* Analyse key variables to identify trends and distribution of data.
* Analysing and visualising relationships between key variables

**Note:** These notebooks are my completed assignments from the IBM Data Analyst course on Coursera.
